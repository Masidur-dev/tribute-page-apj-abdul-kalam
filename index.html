          <h2>The Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, fondly known as the
            <b>"Missile Man of India" </b>was a visionary scientist and a
            beloved leader whose contributions to India's defense and space
            programs were monumental. He played a key role in the development of
            ballistic missile technology and was instrumental in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests, marking the countryâ€™s emergence as a
            nuclear power. Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was a
            humble and inspiring teacher, deeply committed to empowering the
            youth and igniting young minds. His life journeyâ€”from a small town
            in Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavanâ€”continues to motivate
            millions to dream big, work hard, and serve the nation with
            integrity.
